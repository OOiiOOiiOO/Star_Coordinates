    "## What is an electrocardiogram?\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that records the heart's electrical activity. By placing electrodes on the body's surface, ECG provides valuable information about the heart's rate, rhythm, and overall health. Originally invented by Einthoven in 1902 [1], ECG has become a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ECG has numerous clinical applications, including:**\n",
    "    - **Diagnosis**: Detecting various heart conditions such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, and cardiomyopathies [2].\n",
    "    - **Monitoring**: Tracking patients on medications and those undergoing non-cardiac surgery [3].\n",
    "    - **Screening**: Identifying individuals at risk of heart disease, including athletes [4].\n",
    "    - **Research**: Investigating the effects of drugs on the heart [4].\n",

    "## Understanding ECG Components\n",
    "\n",
    "![HP Waves](10.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The axis refers to the net direction of electrical activity during the heart's depolarization. It is typically expressed as an angle, with a normal range of 0° to 120°. A shift in the axis can indicate various heart conditions, such as left or right ventricular hypertrophy or bundle branch blocks.[8][9]\n",
    "![Axis](4.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "**P Waves**\n",
    "\n",
    "![P Waves](7.jpg)\n",
    "The P wave is the first positive deflection observed on an electrocardiogram (ECG). It represents the electrical depolarization of the heart's atria, leading to their contraction. Normal P waves are typically small, rounded, and less than 120 milliseconds in duration. Abnormal P waves can indicate various atrial abnormalities, such as enlargement or fibrillation.[8][10]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Normal P Wave Size*** \n",
    "    - Duration <120ms (3mm)\n",
    "    - Amplitude <2.5mm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**PR interval**\n",
    "\n",
    "![PR interval](8.png)\n",
    "The PR interval is the time from the onset of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. It reflects conduction through the AV node.\n",
    "The normal PR interval is between 120 – 200 ms (0.12-0.20s) in duration (three to five small squares).[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PR interval reflects the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles via the AV node. \n",
    "\n",
    "**QRS Complex**\n",
    "\n",
    "![QRS Complex](9.jpg)\n",
    "he QRS complex is the ventricular contraction (systole) consisting of the Q wave, which is the first negative deviation, followed by the R wave, a positive (upward) deviation. Any negative deflection following immediately after the R portion is termed the S wave.[12]\n",
    "The normal duration is 0.06 to 0.10 seconds. A widened QRS complex may suggest bundle branch block or ventricular origin of the depolarization (e.g., in ventricular tachycardia).[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**QT Interval**\n",
    "\n",
    "![QT Interval](11.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The QT interval measures the time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. It represents the total time required for the ventricles to depolarize and repolarize. A prolonged QT interval can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms, such as torsade de pointes.[8][9]\n",
    "\n",
    "The QT interval is most commonly measured in lead II for evaluation of serial ECGs, with leads I and V5 being comparable alternatives to lead II. Leads III, aVL and V1 are generally avoided for measurement of QT interval.[14]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Bazett's formula* \n",
    "The most commonly used QT correction formula is the Bazett's formula,[5] named after physiologist Henry Cuthbert Bazett (1885–1950),[6] calculating the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcB).[15]\n",
    "Bazett's formula is based on observations from a study in 1920. Bazett's formula is often given in a form that returns QTc in dimensionally suspect units, square root of seconds. The dimensionally correct form of Bazett's formula is:\n",
    " $$QTc = QT / √RR$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - QTc is the corrected QT interval\n",
    "    - QT is the measured QT interval\n",
    "    - RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (representing one heartbeat)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bazett's formula* \n",
    "Fridericia's formula is another method for calculating the corrected QT interval (QTc) on an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is considered to be more accurate than Bazett's formula, especially at faster heart rates. [16]\n",
    "$$QTc = QT / RR^(1/3)$$\n",
    "    - QTc is the corrected QT interval\n",
    "    - QT is the measured QT interval\n",
    "    - RR is the interval between two consecutive R waves (representing one heartbeat)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ST Segment**\n",
    "\n",
    "![ST Segment](12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ST segment is the flat line between the end of the QRS complex and the start of the T wave. It represents the time between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. An elevated ST segment can indicate a heart attack, while a depressed ST segment can indicate myocardial ischemia or other heart conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T Waves**\n",
    "\n",
    "![T Waves](13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The T wave represents ventricular repolarization, the recovery phase after depolarization. It should be upright in most leads and is usually rounded and asymmetrical. Abnormal T waves can suggest myocardial ischemia, electrolyte imbalances, or other conditions.[17]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a heart attack?\n",
    "A heart attack is caused by a blockage in one of the vessels of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common ECG indicator of a heart attack is ST segment elevation, which represents the start of ventricular relaxation. ST elevation in two or more leads viewing the same heart region increases suspicion of a heart attack .[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "![Heart attack](2.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "ECG changes, along with elevated troponin levels, can indicate the need for a trip to a Cath Lab to check for heart blockages. In some cases, a person with chest pain and a suspicious ECG may be sent to the Cath Lab before blood test results are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heart rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart rate is the number of beats per minute, and the body adjusts it based on activity or environment. It increases during activity, excitement, or fear, and decreases when resting or calm .[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a normal adult heart rate?**\n",
    "- **Normal:** 60-100 bpm\n",
    "- **Tachycardia:** > 100 bpm\n",
    "- **Bradycardia:** < 60 bpm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular heart rhythm**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a patient has a regular heart rhythm, their heart rate can be calculated using the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply identify two consecutive R waves and count the number of large squares between them. By dividing this number into 300 (remember, this number represents 1 minute) we are able to calculate a person’s heart rate.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate = 300 / number of large squares between consecutive R waves.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Count*** the number of ***large squares*** present within one ***R-R interval***.\n",
    "- ***Divide*** 300 by this number to calculate heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Heart rate calculation example***\n",
    "4 large squares in an R-R interval\n",
    "300/4 = 75 beats per minute\n",

    "### ECG Signal with Detected R-Peaks\n",
    "This plot shows the ECG signal along with the detected R-peaks (red crosses). The X-axis represents time in seconds, and the Y-axis represents the heart's electrical signal in millivolts (mV). The red crosses indicate the R-peaks of the QRS complex, which are used to calculate the heart rate. This visualization helps in confirming the accuracy of R-peak detection and understanding the heart's rhythm.\n",
