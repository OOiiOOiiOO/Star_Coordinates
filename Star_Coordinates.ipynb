    "## Understanding Star Coordinates in Pattern Recognition\n",
    "Star coordinates is a tool for visualizing multi-dimensional data. Given a dataset, Star Coordinates allocates an axis on a 2D circle to each attribute in the dataset. Initially, all the lengths and the angles between the axes are equal. Additionally, each data entry is mapped on the 2D space by aggregating the effect of all the axes (attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to interact with star coordinates. Adjusting the length of an axis allows the user to increase and decrease the overal effect of a variable. The angle between any two attributes shows how they are related. Finally, the user has the option of turning off an axis to exclude an attribute from the analyis.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept:\n",
    "+ Polar Coordinate Transformation: Each data feature is mapped to an angle on a unit circle. A weight is then assigned to each feature, which is multiplied by its corresponding value to calculate the polar coordinate (radius). This ensures that more significant features exert a greater influence on the point's position in the 2D space.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Multidimensional Visualization in 2D Space: High-dimensional data can be represented as a scatter plot in a 2D graph. Each point in this plot corresponds to a data sample, and its position reflects the sample's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Pattern Recognition: By examining the distribution of points on the scatter plot, we can identify patterns and clusters within the data. These patterns can reveal relationships between different data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine we have a dataset of customers with features like age, income, and spending habits. Using star coordinates, we can map these customers onto a 2D plot. Customers with similar characteristics, such as young adults with high spending habits, might cluster together, revealing a potential market segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages: \n",
    "Compared to techniques like Parallel Coordinates, Star Coordinates offer a space-efficient and less cluttered visualization, though at the cost of some precision​ [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Star Coordinates:\n",
    "+ **Visual Exploration**: Provides an intuitive way to explore complex datasets.\n",
    "+ **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space for easier visualization.\n",
    "+ **Pattern Discovery**: Helps identify hidden patterns and relationships within data.\n",
    "+ **Outlier Detection**: Can highlight unusual data points that may warrant further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "+ **Anomaly detection**: Identifying unusual data points that deviate from the norm.\n",
    "+ **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.\n",
    "+ **Feature selection**: Determining the most important features in a dataset.\n",
    "+ **Visualization of high-dimensional data**: Creating visual representations of complex data for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Concepts of Star Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset with N features (for example, 8 features). Each feature is represented as a vector in a two-dimensional space. For each data point x, composed of N features x1, x2, ..., xN, the final coordinate P in the two-dimensional space is calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Horizontal Axis} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(x_i \\cdot \\cos\\left( \\theta _{i} \\right) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Vertical Axis=\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(x_i* sin\\left( \\theta _{i} \\right) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing Star Coordinate Visualization with User Feedback for High-Dimensional Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The innovative approach introduced in the proposed method is dynamic weighting of the axes. Instead of uniformly considering all dimensions, each axis (dimension) is assigned a specific weight, which can vary over time. The proposed formula is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Horizontal Axis = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\left( \\alpha_i \\cdot x_i \\cdot \\cos \\left( \\theta_i \\right) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Vertical Axis=\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(\\alpha_i \\cdot x_i* sin\\left( \\theta _{i} \\right) \\right)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Innovation:\n",
    "The primary innovation in this method is the use of dynamic weights for each dimension. By doing so, rather than displaying the data with equal emphasis on all dimensions, we can place more emphasis on specific features. For instance, as **the weights ($ \\alpha_i $) change over time** (as seen in the animation from the code above), data points shift in a way that highlights the more important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dynamic changes can lead to more precise and insightful visual analysis. This approach is particularly useful when the data has features with varying levels of importance, allowing for better representation by adjusting the weights.\n",

    "The time change introduces a dynamic modification to the proposed star coordinates through the current_weights. These weights are based on a sine wave that shifts over time, specifically depending on the value of frame. This shifting sine wave introduces variability in the weight given to each feature in the proposed star coordinates calculation. As a result, the animation shows how the star coordinates evolve when the contribution of different features varies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Coordinates (blue) remain static, as they do not depend on time.\n",

    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "These two vectors represent two points (objects) in an 8-dimensional space, where each element corresponds to the value of a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Calculating Standard Coordinates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def standard_star_coordinates(data, angles):\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function is similar to the previous one, but the weights for each feature dynamically change with each frame. This is done by applying a sinusoidal function to generate varying weights, allowing for more flexibility in the data representation.\n",
