# Star_Coordinates
 This project was done for the pattern recognition course in the master's degree in artificial intelligence and robotics at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad under the supervision of Professor Hadi Sadoghi Yazdi.

## Understanding Star Coordinates in Pattern Recognition
Star coordinates is a tool for visualizing multi-dimensional data. Given a dataset, Star Coordinates allocates an axis on a 2D circle to each attribute in the dataset. Initially, all the lengths and the angles between the axes are equal. Additionally, each data entry is mapped on the 2D space by aggregating the effect of all the axes (attributes).
